## License

I decided to include the MIT License because it's the simplest and most common one used in small GitHub projects.  
I'm still learning how all this works, so I picked something easy to understand.  
From what I read, the MIT License basically means people are free to use, modify, or share the code if they want,  
and at the same time I'm not responsible if something goes wrong when they use it.  
That felt reasonable for a beginner project like this.
